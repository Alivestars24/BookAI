# BookAI 

This is simply a demonstration of my forntend skills by recreating a component from BookAI website.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Alivestars24/BookAI.git
    ```

1. Install the required packages.
    ```sh
    cd BookAI
    npm install
    ```

1. Start the development server.
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
1. Open the project in your browser at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to view your project.


The project is set up to use `postcss-cli` to process your CSS files. You can add your own `tailwind.config.js` file to customize your Tailwind setup.
